## Overview and Origin

Ant Financial  was founded on October 16, 2014 in Hangzhou, China as an offshoot of Alibaba, know as Alipay, then in 2015 settled on the name Ant Financial in 2015 according to Reuters. The company orginally run by china richest man, Jack Ma is one of a vast nubmer of compaines under Ma's parent company Alibaba. Alipay was oringially created as a reliable way for customers to make payments within Ma's e-commerce business Taobao according to Reuters. In 2015, just one year after creation, it recieved $4.5 billion in funding according to Forbes, for investors around the globe. The idea behind the company was to create an easy to use online or mobile financial transaction platform for chinese consumers that provides services like mobile payments and lending.  


## Business Activities:

Ant Financial has become, and is still a hugely distruptive force in the chinese banking industry. According to the Wall Street Journal in 2018, it completed more than $ 8 trillion in transation value. to put that in perspective that is nearly half the G.D.P of United States last year. The concpet of total digital banking, is currently far more popular in the most recently developed countries, i.e. China and India, than in the west. The size and scope Ant, has already forced large instiutitonal banks, not only in China, but in the west to adapt similar practices are and rethink the traditional brick and mortar setup of most large western to banks and substantially increase their online prescene in recent years. 


## Landscape:

Ant Finanical's massive success has not doubt started a boom in online banking all over the word, with so many compaines poping up all over the world looking to disrupt the banking indusrty, one of the oldest and often times antiquated industries in the world. Undoubtly, the trend of banking is to be more online peer-to-peer transcations, to cut out the middle man altogher, but the big banks and governments, will have their say. As point out in the Wall Street Journal article big banks are demanding that the Chinese government step in and regulate and scrutinize the company more like a tradition bank. The company pushed back saying they are their to more or less supplement to banks, helping customers gain easier access to capital, not to put the banks out of business.  


## Results

The results so far are great for Ant, not so much for the largest banks in China or around the world who are stuck in the old way of lending and banking via brick mortar or in person on paper. To digitiliaze and even help decentralize, as a recent crunch base article points out, that Ant is now helping launch a blockchain solution for small business and developers to help them launch an app and take advantage of these peer-to-peer technologies. With the current state of the world, and most of the world economy in a semicomatose state due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the world may never return to what we deemed as normal before. Person to person interaction my be forever tainted, mostly out of fear, of what if something like this were to happen again. The transtion to fully online banking and lending might be more rapid than any one might have predicted.  


## Recommendations

As a recommendation, I would suggest that they need to double their efforts on the same trajectory, with the idea that the big banks are the ones who will need to be transitioning to more online based. I really like the idea as well, that they are already helping small business with blockchain to setup as so they can take advantage of these technologies. Another potential opportunity is crypto based lending, this is a potential idea that might be worth looking into. Not only the universal nature of cryptos, but as we can see how traditional markets are being decimatied by a natural event like the COVID-19, we have seen a relatively stable performance from crypto. Bitcoin YTD is up 5.70% where as the S & P is down nearly 15%. I would not go so for as to say it is recession proof, but if it can hold up in this environment, that is a strong indicicatior.
